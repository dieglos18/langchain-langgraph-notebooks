    "\n",
    "In language models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, the `temperature` parameter controls the randomness or creativity of the model's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Temperature (close to 0):**  \n",
    "  The model becomes more deterministic and focused. It tends to pick the most probable next word, making responses more precise, predictable, and repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Temperature (closer to 1):**  \n",
    "  The model becomes more random and creative. It explores less probable words, generating more varied, imaginative, and sometimes surprising responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- `temperature=0.0`: The model behaves conservatively, providing very consistent and factual outputs.\n",
    "- `temperature=0.7`: A balance between creativity and reliability. Useful when you want natural, human-like conversation.\n",
    "- `temperature=1.0`: The model gets very creative, good for brainstorming ideas or writing fiction.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:**  \n",
    "> If you want clear and accurate information, use a low temperature.  \n",
    "> If you want more creative, diverse outputs, use a higher temperature.\n"
